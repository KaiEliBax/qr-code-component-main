## Overview

I am brand new to coding and I've become fairly passionate about it. I'm excited for all of the new things that I will learn through these challenges. Here is my solution to the QR-code challenge.

## My Process

### What I learned

I re-learned how to center things on the page using CSS. For some reason I always have trouble with that. However, I still feel like I'm using more of a trial and error system as opposed to actually having a plan for centering things.

.centered-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}


### Continued development

I need to work on becoming more efficient with CSS. 90% of the time I am trying 10 different ways to solve 1 problem. I also need to learn more about positioning.
